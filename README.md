# GFG-Hackathon

Hello there!

The Logic Gates Simulator is Team VHS' submission for the Geekvishwa Hackathon.

Our simulator makes it easier for Electronics students to quickly simulate easily editable combinations of the AND, OR and NOT gates, which is a tedious job to do on paper.

Here are the steps to run this simulator:

Step 1: Navigate to the folder location in Command Prompt.
Step 2: Type the command "javac Main.java"
Step 3: A class file will appear in the same directory.
Step 4: Now write the command "java Main" and press enter.
Step 5: The code will start to run in the CLI of Command Prompt.
Step 6: Repeat steps 1-5 with drag_n_drop.java instead of Main.java and "drag_n_drop" instead of "java Main" to see the GUI of the program.

Due to a lack of time, we haven't been able to implement the entire program to run with a single click from the user. 
We also originally planned to include additional logic gates (XOR, XNOR, NAND, NOR) and configure their combinations to complete the project in its entirety.

We would still be interested in incorporating these features if given the opportunity to.
